"""Business logic for the extension registry: validates a manifest, enrolls its
actions into the existing RBAC catalog (`actions` table), persists the
extension + its upstreams/routes, and issues/rotates its keys.

Registration does not grant those actions to roles. Role assignment stays in the
normal RBAC UI. Deregister still strips an extension's actions from every role
so a deleted extension does not leave grants behind.

Owns *what* a registration means, not *how* a route runs (that's runtime.py) or how
it's bound to a dynamic FastAPI signature (a later stage's scope). Every function here
is a plain async function taking the repositories it needs as parameters, no
module-level state, so it can be exercised the same way from the management router
(DI) or from tests.
